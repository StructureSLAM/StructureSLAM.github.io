# Lifelong Robotic Vision Datasets

The OpenLORIS datasets were originally built for the [Lifelong Robotic Vision Challenge]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/competition/index.html) on IROS 2019. Then we added more data to facilitate research on several subtopics of lifelong robotic vision. We welcome contribution of data from third parties, as long as the data are relevant to lifelong robotic vision research and are in a good enough quality. Please contact [Qi She](mailto:sheqi.roger@bytedance.com) and [Xuesong Shi](mailto:shixuesong@gmail.com) for contribution or collaboration.

Follow the dataset pages and corresponding papers for more details:
